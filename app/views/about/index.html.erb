    <h3>About Karen Sue</h3>
    <p>
      In 2009, our mom, Karen Sue Danielson, was diagnosed with Stage
      3B Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). IBC is not detectable in
      mammograms, so usually by the time it is diagnosed, as with
      our mom, it has already spread. She fought long and hard, never
      giving up faith, never giving up hope. We originally started
      the golf tournament to support alternative treatments outside
      of the country for our mother. Unfortunately, she lost her
      battle with cancer in September 2011.
    </p>
    <h3>Keeping a promise</h3>
    <p>
      We made a promise to her that we would run the tournament no
      matter what happened for as long as we could to support a cause
      close to her heart. This is our eleventh year and we are hoping
      that itâ€™s our biggest.

      Mom was an unbelievably loving and caring woman. Always there
      to lend a hand, flash a smile, say the right words, or just
      give you a warm hug. She always knew what to do and when to
      do it. Our parents were foster parents and our mom had a strong
      passion to help kids less fortunate.
