In 2009, our mom, Karen Danielson, was diagnosed with Stage
3B Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). IBC is not detectable in
mammograms, so usually by the time it is diagnosed, as with
our mom, it has already spread. She fought long and hard, never
giving up faith, never giving up hope. We originally started
the golf tournament to support alternative treatments outside
of the country for our mother. Unfortunately, she lost her
battle with cancer in September 2011.

We made a promise to her that we would run the tournament no
matter what happened for as long as we could to support a cause
close to her heart. This is our fifth year and we are hoping
that it’s our biggest.

Mom was an unbelievably loving and caring woman. Always there
to lend a hand, flash a smile, say the right words, or just 
give you a warm hug. She always knew what to do and when to 
do it. Our parents were foster parents and our mom had a strong
passion to help kids less fortunate. We are very proud, and 
honored to have a partnership with the Shiloh House in which
all the funds we raise go to.

The Shiloh House is a 501 (C) (3) that offers both residential
and non-residential treatment for the treatment of male and 
female youth. They are greatly involved in foster care and they
also give back and help the community.

alive and strong!
